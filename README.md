# Portfolio

Feel free to visit my [live](https://cynwong.github.io/portfolio/) site.

This project is for my portfolio as well as my lab. This project will grow along side me. Therefore, it will be under constant changes.

Since this site is double as my playground, I am using HTML5, SCSS and jQuery for this version 2. I chose to use jQuery instead of vanilla JavaScript because I like jQuery's much shorter code style. But since the technology is advancing and my skills are also growing, I challenged myself to always maintain and evolve this site.

## Technology used

    * HTML / HTML5
    * SCSS used to generate CSS
    * jQuery, Javascript
