# Portfolio

Feel free to visit my [live](https://cynwong.github.io/portfolio/) site.

This project is my portfolio as well as my lab. This project will grow along side me. Therefore, it will be under constant changes.

## Technology used

    * HTML / HTML 5
    * CSS / CSS 3
    * jQuery

Since this site is double as my playground,  I challenged myself to use as little third party API and Framework. I am using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery for now. I chose to use jQuery instead of vanilla JavaScript because I want to support older browsers and jQuery's much shorter code style. But since the technology is advancing and my skills are also growing, one of the things on my bucket list is to change jQuery to pure vanilla javascript for this site.
