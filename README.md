# Portfolio

Feel free to visit my [live](https://cynwong.github.io/portfolio/) site.

This project is my portfolio as well as my lab. This project will grow along side me. Therefore, it will be under constant changes.

### Technology used

Since this is my testing ground. I chalenged myself to use as little thrid party API and Framework. I am using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery for now. I chose to use jQuery instead of vanilla JavaScript because I wants to support older browsers and shorter coding style. But since the technology is advancing and my skills are also growing, one of my bucket list is to change jQuery to pure vanilla javascript for this site.
